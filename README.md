Fashion Image Classification: A Deep Learning Approach using CNN"
Project description: In our project, we use deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), to make a model that can recognize 10 different fashion styles.This work shows how AI and deep
learning can help with fashion image classification and set the stage for broader fashion applications like
helping people with their style and suggesting fashion items for online shopping.
Tools & technologies used: Python, Google Collab, Scikit-learn.
